# Super-Smash-Bros-Melee-Trend-Analyzer
Analyzes the trend of Melee, due to ongoing concerns about its decline.

Super Smash Bros. Melee is a Nintendo fighting game released in 2001.
It quickly gained a competitve scene since its release, and the scene
grew over time due to the technical, fast-paced, edge-guarding reliant
features of the game. Recently, there has been concerns where Melee's
community is declining due to the recent release and rise of Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate this year, and Melee's reliant on older technologies
(e.g. CRT screens) that are no longer produced. This program will
collect data and represent the state of Melee's competitive scene.
